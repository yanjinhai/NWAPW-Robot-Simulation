Autonomous and Teleoperated Robot Simulation in Unity

The Simulation:
	The goal of the simulation is to score points, and this is done shooting balls 
into baskets and placing blocks in the stack areas. This can be done by the user using
the keyboard controls, or by the computer by using the toggle mode button to switch 
to autonomous.

Keyboard Controls:

Arrow Keys - Movement

D - Pick up a ball or block

A - Release the currently held ball or block

S - Toss the currently held ball or block

Left Click - Places a collectible at the location the player clicks

Right Click - Destroys the collectible at the location the player clicks

Left Shift - Rotates camera between 3rd Person, 1st Person, and Top 

UI Controls:

Score - Shows the players score

Change Camera - Rotates camera between 3rd Person, 1st Person, and Top 

Change Mode - Toggles between Teleoperated and Autonomous 

Toggle Place - Toggles the ability to place and destroy collectables 

Ball/Block – Toggles between placing balls and blocks

Quit - Closes the simulation

Restart - Restarts the simulation
